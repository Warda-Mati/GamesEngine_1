For my assignment I plan to make a procedural infinite field in space. The player will be able to move around the field, and I hopefully will make it possible to land on certain planets . As well as planets, I plan to decorate my scene with asteroids, aliens with procedural animations, spaceships and shooting starts and satellites around my scene that will slowly move around aimlessly. 

I will try to use terrain generation to give the planets a certain shape, and objects will spawn around while the players move around, I will have features to let players take control of nearby spaceships and sattelites, as well as hopefully land and walk around planets.


Here is a tutorial I found

I took some inspiration from these following images

# Readme

this is a solar system created using the Unity game engine. The planets have been created procedurally by creating a sphere mesh and adjsuting the points based on noise. this implementation has been greatly inspired by the series that can be seen in the below link,though some changes were made to simplfy the code a bit.

the player is able to land on planets, switching from the spaceship to a capsule representing the astronaut. this is done by disabling the cameras between the ship back and forth.

other than the planets,a sun and moon have been created by using smoke textures and particle system lighting. if the player gets too close to the sun, the healthbar will drop and the player will be destroyed. Other creations I have made are asteroid fields that spawn asteroids, and will split into several smaller asteroids if shot by the spaceship. alien spaceships will spawn and will wander aimlessly. these can be shot down by the player to break it. this was inspired by the tank lab done in class

The player has a targeting system and can shoot bullets, shooting bullets have been taught in class, but modifications were made so that it will follow the target, in which the player can move as well


# Controls

Move : W,A,S,D
Move Target : Y (up) , G(left), H(down),J(right)
Shoot : K
Land on Planet : P

# What I'm most proud of
I am really proud with the amount learnt throughout this course and epsecialy from outside the course. i have gained alot of knowledge on how to implement cool meshes and particle affects from outside resources. although time is limited for this project, in the near future, I will defintely continue researching resources to further develop my skills.
