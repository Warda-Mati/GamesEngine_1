 GameEngines_Assignment_1
 
For my assignment I plan to make a procedural infinite field in space. The player will be able to move around the field, and I hopefully will make it possible to land on certain planets . As well as planets, I plan to decorate my scene with asteroids, aliens with procedural animations, spaceships and shooting starts and satellites around my scene that will slowly move around aimlessly. 

I will try to use terrain generation to give the planets a certain shape, and objects will spawn around while the players move around, I will have features to let players take control of nearby spaceships and sattelites, as well as hopefully land and walk around planets.

I took some inspiration from these following images
